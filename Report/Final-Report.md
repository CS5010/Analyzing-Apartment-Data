## Introduction
We set out to understand how apartments are priced in the United States. 
This has both applications for both tenants and landlords. 
Tenants would benefit from unbiased pricing information when signing or renewing lease agreements.
Landlords, especially those with limited property holdings, could ensure they are charging suitable rent. 
Moreover, landlords could determine which amenities would have the highest return-on-investment.

Beyond pricing, we also sought to understand how amenities vary in the ‘average’ apartment across cities. This is designed to help people moving to new cities decide where they are most likely to get the housing they desire.
